##### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

#1. Read the theory of the experiment completely before performing this experiment

#2.  The fundamental harmonic f0=W0/2*pi and amplitude of the respective harmonics will be set by the students.

#3. The student will have to observe the change in the waveform for different values of the amplitude of integer harmonics and enter the observation into the table manually.

#4. One set of all relative values have been already provided on the screen which is used to generate the periodic square waveform.

#5. The student will change all the values with the help of sliders accordingly.

#6. The student will have to enter the amplitude values of all the integer harmonics into the table manually.

#7. V1 is the voltage value of the fundamental harmonic f0.

#8. V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, and V7 are the amplitude values of the integer multiples of the harmonic. For example, V2 is the amplitude of the second harmonic, etc.

#9. The student can print the table with the help of the print button.
