## Theory
<p>
Square wave can be made with the fundamental frequency and proper harmonics frequency value selection. Following equation is the Trigonometric representation of Continuous Time Fourier Series (CTFS) for periodic signal f(t), with a fundamental harmonic ω_0.

 Above expression is clearly revealing that, the plot of a periodic perfect square wave requires infinite number of harmonics. These harmonics are the integer multiple of fundamental harmonics ω_0 (ω_0=2π/T, where T is the fundamental time period of the wave). The term a_0,a_n,b_n can be expressed as
